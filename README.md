- **Memory**: 512 MB available RAM
- **Storage**: 100 MB + log storage
- **.NET**: Framework 4.7.2+ (included in Windows 10 1803+)
- **Privileges**: Administrator for installation

### Quick Start

1. **Download and Install**
   ```batch
   # Download POSMonitor_v1.0.0_Setup.msi
   # Run as Administrator
   msiexec /i POSMonitor_v1.0.0_Setup.msi
   ```

2. **Configure Target Process**
   Edit `C:\ProgramData\POSMonitor\pos-monitor-config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "monitor": {
       "process_name": "YourPOSApp.exe"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start Monitoring**
   ```batch
   net start POSMonitor
   ```

### Service Management

**Using Batch Menu:**
```batch
manage-service.bat
```

**Using PowerShell:**
```powershell
Import-Module .\POSMonitor-ServiceManager.ps1
Get-POSMonitorStatus
Get-POSMonitorLogs -Count 20
Test-POSMonitorHealth
```

**Using Commands:**
```batch
# Start/Stop service
net start POSMonitor
net stop POSMonitor

# Check status
sc query POSMonitor
```

### Configuration

Edit `C:\ProgramData\POSMonitor\pos-monitor-config.json`:
```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "process_name": "YourPOSApp.exe",
    "performance_interval": 60,
    "hang_timeout_seconds": 5
  }
}
```

### Testing & Validation

```batch
# Validate deployment
test-deployment.bat

# Check service health
powershell -Command "Import-Module '.\POSMonitor-ServiceManager.ps1'; Test-POSMonitorHealth"

# Apply security hardening
apply-security.bat
```

## Architecture

The monitor uses a multi-threaded architecture with separate threads for:
- Performance metrics collection
- Process existence monitoring  
- UI hang detection
- Windows Event Log monitoring
- Self resource monitoring
- Async log writing

### Key Components

1. **Core Monitor** (`pos-monitor-core.py`) - Main orchestrator
2. **Hang Detector** (`pos-monitor-hang-detector.py`) - UI responsiveness
3. **Event Log Monitor** (`pos-monitor-event-log.py`) - Windows event logs
4. **Async Logger** (`pos-monitor-async-logger.py`) - High-performance logging

## Log Output

Logs are written to `C:\ProgramData\POSMonitor\logs\` in daily JSON files:
- Performance metrics every 60 seconds
- Hang events when detected
- Event log errors and warnings
- Crash details with exit codes
- Monitor health metrics every 5 minutes

Log files are automatically:
- Rotated when they exceed size limits
- Compressed when rotated
- Deleted after retention period
